# 👋 Hi, I’m @retromanc3r  

I'm a creative security researcher and low-level programmer with a strong interest in cryptography, firmware development, and hardware hacking. I enjoy working with microcontrollers, designing secure systems, and optimizing code for performance and efficiency.  

## 👀 I’m interested in  
- Embedded systems and firmware development  
- Cryptographic security (AES, RSA, ECDSA, secure key storage)  
- Low-level programming (C and Assembly)  
- Hardware communication (SWI, I2C, SPI, UART)  
- Raspberry Pi Pico and microcontroller projects  
- ESP32 projects  
- Custom drivers for displays, sensors, and peripherals  

## 🌱 I’m currently learning  
- Secure implementations of AES encryption and decryption using ATECC608A  
- Real-time clock integration with DS3231  
- Bus Pirate automation and bus analysis for embedded devices  

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on  
- Open-source embedded projects  
- Low-level cryptography implementations  
- Custom firmware for microcontrollers
